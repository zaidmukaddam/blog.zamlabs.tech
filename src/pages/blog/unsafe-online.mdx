# Is It Ok To Be Unsafe Online?

In 2022, protecting your privacy and online activities is not optional.

## The Current Trends

Everything you need to start hacking is available for free online, and by “online” I mean the “regular web” like YouTube tutorials or blogs, not the dark web or whatever hidden blackmarkets people go to buy illegal stuff or just for the thrill. I don’t see many encouraging trends, though:

- default security settings in apps and products are often terrible or inexistent
- convenience almost always prevails over basic security
- most free products have a huge price in terms of privacy
- authorities praise the sacrifice of individual freedom but it doesn’t seem to (and will probably never) bring more safety
- many websites push users towards predictable security strategies
- cyberattacks are skyrocketting these days (e.g., DDoS, ransomware, spear phishing)
- while unwise attackers can end up in jail, the legal uncertainty in some countries will likely penalize more the victims than their adversaries
