# Building a metronome: React vs Alpine

<img src="/images/react-vs-alpine.png" alt="React vs Alpine" class="rounded-xl" />

Lately, I've been learning to use [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/), a minimal javascript framework ideal for adding
interactivity to static websites. The framework is awesome. It let's you add reactive behaviour without leaving the
HTML, but it also allows you to decouple the logic from the UI. This is specially useful when building complex
components.

In this article I'm going to compare React and Alpine by building a simple
[metronome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metronome). Keep in mind that this is not going to be the best implementation.
A better approach would be to use the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API),
but we're going to keep it simple for now. Our main goal is to use the two frameworks.

## React

Let's try the metronome. Click start and you should listen to a click that repeats over time. You can change the speed
by manipulating the range input.

<ReactMetronome client:visible />

Now let's take a look a the code.

```javascript
const Metronome = () => {
  const { bpm, setBpm, isPlaying, setIsPlaying } = useMetronome();

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <div>{bpm} BPM</div>
        <input
          type="range"
          min="60"
          max="240"
          value={bpm}
          onChange={event => setBpm(event.target.value)}
        />
      </div>
      <button onClick={() => setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}>
        {isPlaying ? "Stop" : "Start"}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

We're using a custom hook called `useMetronome` that is returning the following variables:

- `bpm`: Beats per minute. It sets the speed of the repeating click sound.
- `isPlaying`: It sets whether or not the audio is playing.
- `setBpm` and `setIsPlaying`: Functions to update the previous values.

We're updating `bpm` with the range input and `isPlaying` with the button.

Let's now take a look at the `useMetronome` hook.

```javascript
const useMetronome = () => {
  const [bpm, setBpm] = useState(120);
  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    let timer;
    const click = new Audio("/audio/click.wav");
    if (isPlaying) {
      timer = setInterval(() => click.play(), (60 / bpm) * 1000);
    }
    return () => clearInterval(timer);
  }, [bpm, isPlaying]);

  return { bpm, setBpm, isPlaying, setIsPlaying };
};
```

Almost all the action happens inside `useEffect`. We want to repeat a sound over time so we'll need to set an interval.
We're declaring the `timer` variable to store the interval ID and we're also creating an
[HTMLAudioElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAudioElement) object to play the sound.

If `isPlaying` is true we'll use `setInterval` to repeately play the sound according to the `bpm`.

Then we're returning a cleanup function that will clear the interval if the component is unmounted or if a re-render is
triggered.

We also want to update this behaviour if either `bpm` or `isPlaying` change so we're going to add them to the dependency
array.

## Alpine

Let's do it now with Alpine. The functionality should be the same.

<AlpineMetronome />

If you've never used Alpine it would be great it you can get a little bit familiar before diving into this example. The
Start Here section on the [Alpine Docs](https://alpinejs.dev/start-here) should be more than enough.

With Alpine, you usually write everything in the HTML. However, our component is more complex than usual so weâ€™re going
to use the `Alpine.data` method to decouple the logic from the UI.

Let's start with the HTML.

```html
<div x-data="metronome" x-effect="metronomeEffect">
  <div>
    <div><span x-text="bpm"></span> BPM</div>
    <input type="range" min="60" max="240" x-model="bpm" />
  </div>
  <button
    x-on:click="isPlaying = !isPlaying"
    x-text="isPlaying ? 'Stop' : 'Start'"
  ></button>
</div>
```

In Alpine we use special HTML attributes called Alpine directives.

- `x-data` stores all of our reactive data.
- `x-effect` is similar to `useEffect`. It will re-run `metronomeEffect` when a dependency changes.
- `x-text` will set the text content of an element.
- `x-model` connects the value of the input element to the Alpine data.
- `x-on` allows us to run code when a DOM event is dispatched.

Now let's take a look at the JavaScript code.

```javascript
document.addEventListener("alpine:init", () => {
  Alpine.data("metronome", () => {
    let timer = null;
    const click = new Audio("/audio/click.wav");

    return {
      bpm: 120,
      isPlaying: false,

      metronomeEffect() {
        if (timer) clearInterval(timer);
        if (this.isPlaying) {
          timer = setInterval(() => click.play(), (60 / this.bpm) * 1000);
        }
      },
    };
  });
});
```

`Alpine.data` allows us to register our component. The first argument is the name we're going to use with the `x-data`
directive. The second argument is a function that returns the reactive data we're going to use.

Similar to what we did with React, we're declaring a `timer` variable, creating and HTMLAudioElement object, and setting
`bpm` and `isPlaying` as the state of our component. `timer` and `click` are not inside the return statement so they are
not considered reactive data.

`metronomeEffect` stores the metronome functionality. This is the function we're going to re-run if either `bpm` or
`isPlaying` are updated.

## Final thoughts

React does a great job. What I like the most is that we can use custom hooks to abstract the functionality of our
components. I think it's also going to be the better option if you want to build a Single Page Application.

Alpine doesn't stay behind. We can build simple components without leaving the HTML file, and if we need it, we can also
decouple the logic from the UI.

I prefer React because I'm very used to it. However, Alpine offers a simple way to add reactive behavior to our pages.
I've used it on the navbar of this website, a couple of Ruby on Rails projects, and I plan to continue using it on most
of my static websites.
