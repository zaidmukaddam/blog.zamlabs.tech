# Adding Comments to My Blog with Giscus

<img src="/images/giscus.png" alt="Giscus Logo" class="rounded-xl" />

I started writing for this blog a few weeks ago, and at the time, I didn't even think about the inclusion of a comment
section. I began to think about including one a couple of weeks ago when I discovered Tania Rascia's website and noticed
the use of [utterances](https://github.com/utterance/utterances) to manage the comments on her blog.

Utterances is a widget that uses
[GitHub Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) to store comments. I
liked that. The target audience for my blog is developers. They might already have a GitHub account, so using this
widget seemed to be a great idea.

I was about to try it on my blog, but yesterday I discovered a [giscus](https://github.com/giscus/giscus) while browsing
GitHub. Giscus relies on [GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) instead of Issues. The main
advantage of Discussions is that they have a threaded format (Think about Reddit). But also, by using them, the Issues
page can stay just as an issue tracker. I prefer this way of managing comments.

## Installation

Using giscus is very straightforward. Go to [their website](https://giscus.app) and fill out the configuration form. The
website will generate a code snippet that you can copy directly into your HTML. In the case of my blog, it looked
something like this.

```html
<!-- Container -->
<section class="giscus mx-auto mt-10 max-w-screen-md">
  <!-- Giscus Script -->
  <script
        src="https://giscus.app/client.js"
        data-repo="zaidmukaddam/blogs.zamlabs.tech"
        data-repo-id="R_kgDOH-HLqA"
        data-category="Comments"
        data-category-id="DIC_kwDOH-HLqM4CRWfz"
        data-mapping="pathname"
        data-strict="1"
        data-reactions-enabled="1"
        data-emit-metadata="1"
        data-input-position="top"
        data-theme="preferred_color_scheme"
        data-lang="en"
        data-loading="lazy"
        crossorigin="anonymous"
        async>
</script>
</section>
```
