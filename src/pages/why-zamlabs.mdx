# Why ZAMLABs?

## [Journey so far](https://blog.zamlabs.tech/why-zamlabs#journey-so-far)
I have been building software for over 2 years. As my journey of learning to code began with exploring the world of programming and computers, it made me realize that I have been not just exploring but also experimenting with various programming languages and frameworks.

## [Reason](https://blog.zamlabs.tech/why-zamlabs#reason)
This is what made me add the "labs" to domain name. As "lab" is a place where you experiment with things, here I am experimenting with various technologies and frameworks.
But I am not just experimenting, I am also building things with these technologies and frameworks.

## [Why a blog?](https://blog.zamlabs.tech/why-zamlabs#why-a-blog)
Adding to this, I am also a cybersecurity enthusiast. I have been learning about cybersecurity as its the domain of my degree.
I have been learning about various cybersecurity concepts and tools and i'm planning to write about them in this blog.

## [More about me](https://blog.zamlabs.tech/why-zamlabs#more-about-me)
I am also a competitive programmer. I have been solving problems on various online judges like CodeChef, CodeForces, LeetCode, HackerRank and HackerEarth.

## [What's next?](https://blog.zamlabs.tech/why-zamlabs#whats-next)
I am planning to write about various topics like programming, cybersecurity, competitive programming, and other stuff that I find interesting.

Thanks for reading.
